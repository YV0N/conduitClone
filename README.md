# Conduit Clone
## _Angular and NgRx_

This project is a clone of the Conduit app, built using Angular and Ngrx. The application retrieves data from the same external API as the original website, allowing for an identical user experience. With the power of Ngrx, the project includes state management that provides a more streamlined and efficient approach to handling data within the application. The clone retains all the features of the original, including the ability to browse articles and authors, create and update articles, and manage user profiles. Overall, this clone offers a robust and efficient alternative to the original, built on modern technologies that ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Features
